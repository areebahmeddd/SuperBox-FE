The `logs` command reads CloudWatch logs for a deployed MCP server. It maps to `src/superbox/cli/commands/logs.py` in the backend repo and requires AWS credentials plus registry access in `.env`.

## Usage

```bash
superbox logs --name <server> [--follow|-f]
```

### Options

<ParamField path="--name" type="string" required>
  MCP server name (matches the registry entry and CloudWatch log group).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--follow" type="boolean" default={false}>
  Follow logs in real time (tail). Shorthand: `-f`.
</ParamField>

## Behavior

- Loads `.env` in the current directory for AWS creds/region and S3 bucket.
- Verifies the server exists in the registry bucket.
- Reads from CloudWatch log group `/aws/lambda/superbox-executor-<name>`.
- Prints the last hour by default; with `--follow`, streams continuously.

## Examples

```bash
# Fetch the last hour of logs
superbox logs --name weather-mcp

# Tail in real time
superbox logs --name weather-mcp --follow
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you see “log group not found”, the server may not have been executed yet or the name does not match the deployed Lambda suffix.
- Ensure `.env` contains `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and the registry bucket name (`S3_BUCKET_NAME`).
- Use `superbox search` to confirm the server exists in the registry. If missing, run `superbox push` first.
