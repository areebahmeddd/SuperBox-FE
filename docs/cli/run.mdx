<Warning>
  **DEPRECATED** - This command is no longer supported. Use `superbox pull` to configure MCP servers in your AI client instead.
</Warning>

## Recommended Alternative

Instead of using `superbox run`, configure your MCP server in VS Code, Cursor, or other AI clients:

```bash
superbox pull --name weather-mcp --client vscode
```

Then interact with the server through your AI client's MCP panel or chat interface.

## Why Was This Deprecated?

The `run` command provided a terminal-based interactive session with MCP servers. However, the primary use case for MCP servers is integration with AI clients like VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.

The WebSocket-based architecture is optimized for stdio transport (which AI clients use), not HTTP-based terminal interactions.

## Migration Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Old Workflow">
    ```bash
    superbox run --name weather-mcp
    > What tools are available?
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="New Workflow">
    ```bash
    # Configure in your AI client
    superbox pull --name weather-mcp --client vscode
    
    # Then use the MCP panel in VS Code or ask in chat:
    # "What tools are available in weather-mcp?"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
